# Fees

For each good negotiation will be include  a fee of 0.04%

# How works? 

We will use OP_RETURN used for a transaction between parties when a not realize pay to the other.
Example:

Bob sells 0.05 BTC for Alice with price of 1000 USDT. But Alice not pay Bob. Like this we put OP_RETURN. Saving Bitcoins from Bob.
